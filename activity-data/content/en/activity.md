### HTML Puzzle Boxes

Made by [Yofie Setiawan, Mozilla Indonesia](https://twitter.com/yofiesetiawan) and remixed for Clubs by [Mozilla](https://webmaker.org/mentor).

Learners will race to sequence the paper boxes labeled with HTML tags, **becoming familiar with the most common HTML tags and how to structure a web page**.

45 minutes to an hour

### Preparation

**Complete the** [pre-activity questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/forms/d/1IFhGuK4h7YqxqoUP880_hYV0S8TYEv0sBCbRNBy-0f4/viewform).Do the activity on your own to become familiar with it. See the video to the left under "Activity in Action".

[Print at least 12 copies](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lv7u8tqawawudiy/html-puzzle-box.pdf?dl=0) of the Puzzle Box pattern.

> Creating one Puzzle Box is pretty easy. But, to have enough Puzzle Boxes to play the game, you will need at least 12 boxes â€“ to ensure that you have enough boxes for opening and closing tags. In total, for a pair of players, you need to build 24 boxes. So, to build all 24 boxes, you need to print 12 sheets of the papercraft pattern.
>
> It is preferable to print the Puzzle Box with thick paper, so it will be easier to assemble and will have a better build.
>
> If you are limited on time, you can do this activity by writing on pieces of paper or post-its instead of making boxes.

Have learners complete their [pre-activity questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/forms/d/1i-fPxOGeuq-yxhEx-DYrf_Vj0WHqFpWcsUgF_l6ffOk/viewform).

This is a pretty fun but time-intensive thing. Learners first assemble their boxes. Bonus: If time permits, mentor plays [HTML Corners](https://dajbelshaw.makes.org/thimble/MTk0NDI1Njc2OA==/html-corners) using the boxes to signal the stations.

### HTML Puzzle Box Challenge

First assemble the tags in the right order in a small group. Then race!

This is the right combination of HTML tags structure.

### Reflection: Review the Tags

Repeat the [HTML Corners game](https://dajbelshaw.makes.org/thimble/MTk0NDI1Njc2OA==/html-corners) if time permits. Or, just have students shout out what each tag means.

Bonus: If time permits, show the tags in action by clicking "View Source" or using the X-Ray Goggles on a webpage. Bonus: Tag your environment by putting remixed HTML Puzzle Boxes or post-it notes around the room a la Markup Mixer.

Conclude by asking the group to reflect on what they found.
